This is the meta-owswaas Yocto layer, which implements 
Owen Wilson Saying "Wow" as a Service (OWSWaaS).

You can see a demo of it here:

This layer currently targets the Raspberry Pi Zero (W), but can easily be adapted
to other platforms. To start, you'll need to add a BTN_GPIO definition in
init-owswaas.bb. You may also need to tweak the alsa-state.bbappend.

If you haven't used Yocto before, you can find a quick intro here:
